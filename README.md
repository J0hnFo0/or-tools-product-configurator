Product configurator using constraint programming using Google OR-Tools

This is a project I did during my BSc study of information systems. The task was to develop a web based product 
configurator using constraint programming implemented with Google OR-Tools. 

The frontend was implemented by Uwe Jakob. The original code is stored within the client's bitbucket instance.
